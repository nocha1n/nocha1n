i'm a presence in the wired and use it/its pronouns.

looking to do fun things with [ðŸ¦€ rust](https://github.com/rust-lang), [ðŸ–¥ nix/nixos](https://github.com/NixOS), and whatever else i find interesting.

always wavering between making all my code [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) or [unlicensed](https://unlicense.org/).
